Running the Script:
In order to run the python scripts we provided, the datasets must be downloaded and placed in a folder called “datasets”.
This is because it is hard coded to read files from this folder. The data used in this project was split into many csv files 
so we condensed all the data into two separate csv files containing all the data. One csv file is called allFinance.csv for 
the regression task and allFont.csv for the classification task. In order to obtain these files simply run the loadDataFile() 
function in fonts-XGB.py and the loadDataFile() function in finance-HGB.py. These will create the two csv files in the current 
directory and just need to be moved into the “datasets” folder. The libraries needed to run the scripts are numpy, pandas, 
matplotlib, scipy, xgboost, and scikit-learn.
